   Breaking Down the Keto Diet Basics
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Macronutrient Composition:
    </strong>
    The keto diet typically consists of 70-80% fat, 15-25% protein, and 5-10% carbohydrates, which helps in achieving ketosis.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ketosis: The Metabolic State:
    </strong>
    In ketosis, the liver converts fat into ketones, which become the primary energy source for the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Types of Keto Diets:
    </strong>
    Variations include the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD), targeted ketogenic diet (TKD), and high-protein ketogenic diet.
